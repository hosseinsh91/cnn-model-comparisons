# cnn-model-comparisons
This project explores various deep learning architectures for classifying CIFAR-10 images using TensorFlow/Keras. It implements multiple CNN models with different configurations, compares pooling techniques, optimizes training with learning rate schedulers, and evaluates transfer learning using VGG16.
